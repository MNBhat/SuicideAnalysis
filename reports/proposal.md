## Section 1 Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science research group interested in exploration of mental well being 

Target audience: Research students in mental health counselling , mental health practitioners  

Suicide is a devastating and preventable tragedy that affects individuals, families, and communities around the world. Unfortunately, despite increasing awareness about the importance of mental health care and suicide prevention, suicide rates continue to rise in many parts of the world. This app seeks to address this critical issue by providing a comprehensive dashboard that allows users to explore suicide rates across different countries and demographics. By visualizing this data in a clear and intuitive format, and by highlighting patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed, this app empowers mental health students and practitioners to identify risk factors and develop effective prevention strategies. This app allows the exploration of suicide across multiple groups to help with the better understanding of it. 

## Section 2 Description of Data
In this project , we are using the Suicide Rate Overview dataset ate which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016). This data set has been compiled from the other datasets linked in time and place, using United Nations Development program, World Health Organization Suicide prevention, WHO along with World Bank, world development factors  being a few. The dataset , contains the suicide information for years 1985 to 2016, however in per dataset we would be using since 2006 due to the memory requirements. The dataset has the following features :
- `Country` 
- `Year` 
- `Sex` -(As given in dataset)
- `Age` - age group of the people 
- `Suicide nos` -  number of suicides in the particular year
- `Population`  - population in the year 
- `suicides/100k pop` - suicide per 100k population
- `Country-year` - year and country 
- `HDI for year` - human development index for that year 
- `Gdp_for_year` - gdp for that year 
- `Gdp_per_capita` - gdp per capita for that year 
- `Generation` - generation belonging



## Section 2 Research Questions and usage Scenarios

Some of the questions that could be potentially answered by the dashboard could be as : 
- Are suicide rates more prevelant in certain age groups? 
- Is suicide rate in a country impacted by its gdp?
- Are suicide rates decreasing or increasing in a country?
- Is suicide  more common in a certain gender ? 
- Which country has a highest suicide rate ?

Usage Scenario can be described as follows: 

Bella is a mental health student who is passionate about understanding the root causes of mental health issues, including suicide. She is interested in using data to identify patterns and trends that can inform prevention strategies and interventions. Sarah is currently enrolled in a graduate program in counselling and hopes to eventually work as a practitioner in this field. Sarah is interested in gaining a better understanding of suicide rates across different countries and demographics. She wants to use this information to inform her research and coursework, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to suicide risk. She wants to educate others about suicide prevention strategies and raise awareness about the importance of mental health care. Our app provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and visualize the data. The app gives the option to look at the rates using multiple grouping options, including gender, age, country, and GDP.Moreover, Sarah can use the app as a tool to educate others about suicide prevention strategies and to raise awareness about the importance of mental health care
