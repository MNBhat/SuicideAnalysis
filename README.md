## Suicide Analysis on render 

The dash app has been deployed on render.com It can be accessed [here](https://suicideanalysis.onrender.com/).


## Motivation and research questions

Target audience: Our main target audience includes mental heath graduate research students who are interested in root cause of mental health illness including suicide , and is interested in identifying the patterns and trends that can help form effective prevention strategies.

The main research questions addressed by Suicide Analysis are:

- Are suicide rates more prevelant in certain age groups? 
- Is suicide rate in a country impacted by its gdp?
- Are suicide rates decreasing or increasing in a country?
- Is suicide  more common in a certain gender ? 
- Which countries have a highest suicide rate ?

## Description of the app

Based on the motivation and aim of this app, it has a landing page that shows the suicide rate worldwide and the bar plot showing the countries with highest suicide rate. 

The first global option is a drop down which allows to select a particular country, showing the plot for that country  or in case of without selection it shows worldwide line plot  and a bar plot of 10 countries with highest suicide rate.
 
The second global drop down option allows to group the data by age , gender or gpd when a country is selected in previous dropdown. It allows the data to be analyzed across multiple group. However, when the previous selection is worldwive, the groupings provided in this drop down are gender and age only.  These groupings are shown as a plot and the sum for that particular category as bar plot(Except for gdp).
